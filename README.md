This repository exists to test and refine a series of phonetic changes noted by George Lane (1934, 1935)
while comparing French and Louisiana Creole. These files and programs apply the changes to a set of
Louisiana French data taken from the Dictionary of Louisiana French (2010). These transformed strings
are then compared to a comparable set of Louisiana Creole data taken from the Dictionary of Louisiana
Creole (1998). Matches and non-matches are written to files to allow closer comparison.
